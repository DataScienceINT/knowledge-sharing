# knowledge-sharing

This repository contains information about knowledge sharing for the Data Science INT group.

agenda.md contains the proposed agenda for knowledge transfer sessions. Please register yourself on one of the available dates if you have a topic you would like to conduct a session on.

knowledgeLinks.md contains links/references towards data science (or not) resources that can be of interest for the whole group. If you share something via Teams, please also update this document to that we can keep track!
