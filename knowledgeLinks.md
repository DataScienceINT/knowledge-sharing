- [PubMedBERT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract)
 [REBEL](https://github.com/Babelscape/rebel). Relationship extraction model. HuggingFace model, pluggable on spaCy. Ranked 3rd on relationship extraction the Adverse Drug Events dataset.
- [BioGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/BioGPT). Pre-trained on biomedical literature, claims to outperform SoT models on most biomedical NLP tasks.

### Corpora

- [EuropePMC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.20.529292v1.full.pdf+html). Annotated full text corpus for gene/proteins, diseases and organisms. Link is to the BioarXiv paper, with details on how to access and reuse the resource.
