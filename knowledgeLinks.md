These can be papers, blog posts, podcasts, models, videos, courses, books, etc. Demos developed within the HU (ex: markdown files demonstrating a packages) should also be included.
If possible, please include a short description/key takeaway(s).

## General Data Science

- [Intro to modern statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/)
- [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/). Digital magazine about trends in AI/machine learning, founded by Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. A lot of essay-style articles (a few are linked below). 
- [Discovering novel algorithms with AlphaTensor](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor). Discovery of novel algorithms by AI. Broad possibilities for application in data science/computer science in general. Link to the GitHub repo and article in the article.
-[Explainpaper](https://www.explainpaper.com/). Upload a paper, highlight confusing terms and get an explanation returned (provided by with GPT-3 model).

## Natural Language Processing

### Models

- [SAPBERT](https://huggingface.co/cambridgeltl/SapBERT-from-PubMedBERT-fulltext). HuggingFace model for biomedical entities representation.
- [PubMedBERT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract)

### Papers/Books

- [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks)

### Interesting articles

- [Designing a GPT-3 for science](https://future.com/how-to-build-gpt-3-for-science). Key TAs: death to PDF, articles are a substrate for information combination.
- [Lessons from the GPT-4chan controversy](https://thegradient.pub/gpt-4chan-lessons/). Article about ethics in AI. Interesting TA: possibility to "gate" potentially harmful models so that they are only accessible to researchers.

### Talks
- [NLP Summit](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) A collection of talks about NLP, particularly focused on biomedical/healthcare. Look into tab "Watch past summits".

## Graph ML

## Bayesian

## Neural networks

-[Understanding LSTMs](https://medium.com/@mumbaiyachori/understanding-lstms-6d50b10f2a37)

## Software/Packages/Tools

- [Installing PyTorch Geometric on Mac M1 with Accelerated GPU Support](https://medium.com/@jgbrasier/installing-pytorch-geometric-on-mac-m1-with-accelerated-gpu-support-2e7118535c50). Building an environment for graph machine learning on Macbook with M1.
